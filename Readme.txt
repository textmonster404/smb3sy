Super Mario Bros. 3sy - an easier mario game for the platformer impaired

I am accepting user-created levels for my rom hack called, smb3sy.
Email me at textmonster404@gmail.com.

Its simple.
Create a level, then share the file under smb3sy/PRG/levels/yourleveltileset/yourlevellayout.asm AND the file under smb3sy/PRG/objects/yourlevelobjects.asm
Make sure it has 8 green coins.
Make sure it is reasonable. I am not accepting kaizo levels.
Also, always make sure your level doesn't use 1kb of data. seriously.

For context, all of the original smb3 levels meet all of these requirements EXCEPT for the green coin requirement.

CREDIT GOES TO SOUTHBIRD FOR THE SMB3 DISASSEMBLY AND NODICE EDITOR
Without these tools, this project wouldn't be possible.
SMB3mix is the reason I even wanted to do asm hacking, so thank you
for the inspiration.
