# smb3
Disassembly of Super Mario Bros 3

Specifically for use with NESASM (https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm), this will reassemble into a byte-for-byte perfect clone of Super Mario Bros. 3 US (PRG1)

NOTE: Included are support files for my "NoDice" level editor (game.xml and "icons" subdirectory) and "MusConv" (musconv.xml) utilities. They are not part of the actual source code required to build the ROM, but are necessary if you intend to use these tools.

-------------

To assemble, simply run:

nesasm smb3.asm

Intended for use for research into the inner workings of SMB3 and highly technical ROM hacks (such as Super Mario Bros. 3Mix)
